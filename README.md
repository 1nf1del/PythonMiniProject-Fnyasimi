# PythonMiniProject
Mini-project for the Python for Biologist class at Pwani University

## Scripts 
Contain modules that run the explorer for pdb files.

## Data
Contain different pdb files.

## Results
Whers files should be exported to.

## Usage
To start exploring a pdb file run `pdb_explorer.py`.

#### Disclaimer
The explorer will not display the correct secondary structure for proteins that are coupled to other macromolecules or ligands.

We are working to fix this issue as soon as possible, meanwhile you can visualize secondary structure of proteins that are not bound to any macromolecules or ligands.

**Thank you enjoy your PDB file exploration.**
